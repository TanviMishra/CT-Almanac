How is this work relevant or how does it resonate out in the world?​

Building out expertise internally to prototype and test spatial interactions faster and more collaboratively and positions us to be part of the conversation and anticipate project requests. ​

The continued maturity of [[Augmented Reality]]/[[Mixed Reality]] frameworks and continued investment from tech companies will mean several upcoming opportunities to craft a point-of-view on Spectacle and Drama in the virtual world. ​

In anticipation of some major releases from Apple and Meta in the coming months, we are positioning ourselves to move quickly with new tech. ​

## Activations
Built with [[Unity]] and [[Meta Quest 3]]
#### "Virtual Sculpture" [[Prototype]]

An experiment with placing and interacting with a virtual sculpture in outdoor public place. ​

Solves:​
Evaluating scale within context ​  
Explore possibilities for Participatory Spectacles​

Next Steps:​
Increase interactive capabilities of Prototype​  
Activate Multi-user sessions​  
Explore geo-anchors​

#### "Scale" [[Proof of Concept]]

A proof of concept for placing virtual media surfaces in physical space, evaluating dimensions, and studying composition and arrangement. ​

**Solves:​**
Evaluating spatial media at scale within context​  
Prototyping Interactions without Physical Mockups​

**Next Steps:​**
Integrate Multi-User Space​  
Build out more content Prototyping Tools​
#### "Blocks" [[Proof of Concept]]

![[Screenshot 2024-09-11 at 12.56.45.png|400]]
A proof of concept for building virtual massing models with physical properties that can interact with the local environment.​

**Solves:​**
Virtual sandbox anchored to the real work​  
Prototyping Interactions and design in lieu of Physical Mockups​

**Next Steps:​**
Integrate Multi-User Space​  
Improve UX
combining geometry ​

Look at [[0. Extended Realities]] for progress made in 2024

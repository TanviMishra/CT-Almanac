Always specify Switchable-by-outlet power bars: Each outlet can be turned on/off via IP commands. This is useful if we need to cycle power remotely to a specific device. 

[[UPS]] - typically I ask for 30 minutes of backup power for all servers. They are rated in apparent power (VA  or volt-amps) 

#### Heat Calculations 

[[CRAC]] unit

Watts * 3.412 =  BTU/hr 

20 watt lightbulb * 3.412 = 68.24 BTU/hr of heat load. 

3000 watt LED wall * 3.412 = 10,236 BTU/hr of heat load. 

It takes approximately 0.4 watts of cooling power to offset each 1 watt of power consumed by a light source

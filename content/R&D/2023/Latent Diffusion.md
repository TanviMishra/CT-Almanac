Latent Diffusion is just the technical term for the tools we’ve seen emerging that are labelled as “Generative AI” - models that take text input to generate imagery.​New tools and breakthrough white papers are published every week illuminating new approaches for Machine Learning and its applications to the creative fields. ​By focusing on our ML capabilities in-house we can carve out novel processes and tooling, stay ahead of the curve with application, and develop custom models based on our own IP.​

Nature's beauty and novelty inspires sustainable design practices including solar panels and reduced resource use.​

Public art installations involve the community in playful methods of energy production and introduce circularity in design.​

Projects upcycle and repurpose materials, integrating sustainability narratives into spatial experiences.​

#### Potential Applications:​
- Engaging installations that invite public participation in sustainable energy practices.​
- New standards for zero-waste and sustainable design in project work.​

### Technical Experimentation:
1. [[Flexible Solar Panels​]]
Solar Panel Prototype Research​:
Using battery-powered flexible solar panels in tandem with low-powered physical components installed in the office, we construct a small scalable prototype to power adaptable physical art structures. ​

2. [[Zero Waste Material Innovation​]]

3. [[The Sustainability Toolkit​]]

Seamlessly transition between scales, adapting and transforming with unprecedented flexibility.​

Craft environments that resonate with guests, translate individual experiences, emotions, and interests into unique spatial expressions.​

Transform hand sketches into detailed designs that push the boundaries of our imagination.​

#### Potential Applications:​

- Advanced design tools that enable architects to explore and refine ideas across different scales effortlessly.​
- Interactive environments that dynamically adapt to reflect the personalities and preferences of their users.​
- Rapid prototyping platforms that accelerate the design process.​

#### Technical Experimentation
[[Creative Amplification​]]
[[Personalized Spatial Narratives​]]
[["Model Training"]]
#### Proof of Concept
Translating Dimensions​

Using NeRFs (Neural Radiance Fields), we construct 3D models from 2D images to shrink large spaces down into tiny ones, and to expand small details into massive ones. ​
Training our own models and pairing them with custom tooling to allow design concepts to reveal themselves in ways we hadn’t yet imagined.​

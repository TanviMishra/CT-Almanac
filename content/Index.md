Built using [[Obsidian]] and [[Quartz]]

The 'Almanac' is an internal, living document within LAB @ Rockwell that looks to the future and supplements the team's internal R&D effort.
Eventually, as the Almanac grows, it hopefully presents an opportunity to
1. Be an evergreen resource for the team to build and use
2. Collate and form connections across multiple projects and verticals
3. Begin to visualise trends in new media/technology and chase creative curiosities within the LAB
4. Quickly inform publishing/public-facing efforts
#### Almanac for the Future
Can building the Almanac help us better predict [[Emergent Technologies]] on the innovation triggers and slope of enlightenment?

###### Forms for the Almanac:
1. Wikis
2. ==Digital garden==
3. Notebooks
4. Live case studies
5. Coffee table book
6. Evergreen notes
7. Manual
#### Almanac as a [[What is a Digital Garden?|Digital Garden]]
The digital garden as a metaphor for [[space]]
"Garden moves away from time-bound streams into conceptual knowledge [[space]]; [presents] web as a topology/space" [^1]

"Creative Tech at Rockwell Group specifically applies technology to solving creative problems in [[space]]. While our work extends from being fully digital to fully physical, the constant across both mediums is that our work intersects with and extends [[space]]." [^2]
##### Digital gardens in corporations: 
1. [Gitlab handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/) GitLab, a web-based DevOps lifecycle tool, maintains a comprehensive and open company handbook that serves as a digital garden. 
2. [Basecamp handbook](https://basecamp.com/handbook) - a project management and team collaboration software company uses a digital garden maintained by multiple employees.
#### Suggested Start
[[Creative Tech Process]]
[[AV Systems Design Practices]]
#### Scope:
1. ~~Public facing~~ vs internal document - internal document, with scope to use it as a resource to make future documents to share in the firm
2. Timeline - documentation of 2023 & 2024

#### #uncertain 
1. Challenges of maintaining a digital garden maintained by multiple people - [[Almanac Best Practices]]
2. Figuring out a way of reducing redundancy and duplicates - how can this document supplement the current workflow of using [Presentation](https://rockwellgroup1.sharepoint.com/sites/LabTeamDrive/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=/sites/LabTeamDrive/Shared%20Documents/LAB%20Team%20Drive%20-%202023/Teams/Creative%20Tech/R%26D/Presentations&viewid=9b99af5d-e1a8-4700-8998-292de9e2b822)  and [Miro_Board](https://miro.com/app/dashboard/)
3. How does the Almanac go from being resource gathering towards trend prediction
4. Share/collaborate with multiple people - [Obsidian site](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian+Publish/Collaborate+on+a+Publish+site#:~:text=Obsidian%20Publish%20doesn't%20sync,application%20window%2C%20click%20Publish%20changes%20()
5. Best way to place and link images/iframes
6. What should the upkeep and maintenance be?
	1. [Pricing](https://obsidian.md/pricing) -$8-10/month for publishing it & $50/user/year for a [commercial license](https://help.obsidian.md/Teams/Commercial+license#Purchase%20a%20commercial%20license)

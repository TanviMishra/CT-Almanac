Generative Adversarial Networks​ [[GAN]]
In order to understand and creatively adapt Machine Learning technologies, we attempt to train our own models with data owned by Rockwell Group. ​  
​  
We gathered 16,000 unique variations of Floor Plans from the Rockwell Group network to train our own model.​  
​  
This is the first step to developing more sophisticated tooling. This exercise is a proof of concept that opens possibilities for other forms of experimentation with Machine Learning. ​

**We trained our own model on 16,000 floor plan variants over 20+ years of RWG portfolio.​**

**What were the limitations?​**
We need a set ~100,000 plans to get more meaningful information. ​  
​
**What does this help us do next?​**
Form Finding – defining the shell, filling the site​
Inspiration – Rorschach Drawing, Ideation​
Content – Novel Approaches to Content​
Expanding the training set – renderings and 3D models​
Training other types of Custom models – sensor data, camera feeds, content references​

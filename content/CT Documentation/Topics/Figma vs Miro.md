| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Page numbers     | - easy to auto page numbers using plugins<br>- however, the format required (1.01) is not possible and a [[Figma Plugin]] might be needed                                                                                           | Manually inputted and not ideal | Figma         |               |
| Components       | Good to create a footer component / variant                                                                                                                                                                                         | not possible                    | Figma         |               |
| Layouting        | In my opinion, way better in figma. auto layout helps make things very easy                                                                                                                                                         |                                 | Figma         |               |
| Interaction Flow |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                 | Miro / figjam |               |
| Arrows           | - there are some Figma plugins for drawing arrows but the best I found (flowify) was also not too great<br>- manually drawn arrows don't automatically move with the object<br>- [[figjam]] has similar arrow functionality as miro |                                 | Miro / figjam |               |
| Tables           | Shit in Figma, literally don't make them in figma                                                                                                                                                                                   | Much more intuitive             | Miro / figjam |               |

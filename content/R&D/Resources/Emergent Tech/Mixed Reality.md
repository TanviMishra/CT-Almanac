#### What is Mixed Reality?​

Mixed Reality goes a step beyond Augmented Reality by not only overlaying virtual objects onto the real world but by allowøing these object to interact and respond to the real environment. ​

In Mixed Reality, digital and physical objects coexist and interact in real-time creating a more immersive and interactive experience.​

Imagine a space as flexible as fabric, bending, stretching, and transforming to provide fluid experiences.​

Where manipulation of natural light and shadows creates an enchanting playscape of exploration and creativity.​

Evolving organically and influenced by the collective interactions of those who visit it.​

#### Potential Applications:​
- Environments for hospitality, public spaces, and interactive installations.​
- Future project applications, such as Project W, that emphasize dynamic and interactive spaces.​

#### Technical Experiments
[[Flexible and Transformative Spaces​]]
[[Play of Light and Shadow​]]
[[Surfaces Evolving with Interaction​]]
#### Prototype Development
###### Shape Memory Alloy​
Experiments with voltage and shape memory alloy, later incorporating flexible heat conductive fabrics.​

###### Light Filters​
Tangible material research into the interplay of LED and projected light with architectural materials.​

###### Dichro-netic Prototype​
Research into dichroic materials and kinetic mechanisms that amplify and reveal light.​

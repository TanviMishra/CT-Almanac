This toolkit hopefully lays some groundwork for when we need to work on AR projects. It features a few AR basics and a more robust guide on AR Multiplayer.

All of the work here is done in [[Augmented Reality]] using [[Unity]] and AR Foundation 5. The multiplayer sketches additionally use [[Photon]] PUN 2[^1].

# Context:

This work is built as a part of the [[0. Extended Realities]] branch of R&D 2024.

It is meant to complement work (prototypes and proof of concepts) built in mixed reality. For e.g., the drawing example ([[AR Drawing]]) is a direct synthesis of a proof of concept in MR using shared spatial anchors.
# Next steps

1. Public spectacle AR experience ideation

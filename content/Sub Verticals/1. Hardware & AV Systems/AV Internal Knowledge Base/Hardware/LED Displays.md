#### Parts of an [[LED]] display: 
1. Module: [[PCB]] board with LED display and backer plate - usually magnetically mounted to cabinet. 
2. Cabinet: set of modules. They click together to adjacent cabinets like legos. 
3. [Receiver card](http://www.novaledscreen.com/Uploads/download/Novastar-A10s-Plus-Receiving-Card-Specifications-V1.0.0.pdf): receives LED data via Cat6 cable 
4. [[PSU]] - most LED displays are 5VDC or 4.5VDC 
5. [Processor](https://www.novastar.tech/products/controller/mctrl4k/): connects to receiver cards. Each ethernet port has a maximum amount of pixels. This depends on your color bit depth 
6. Color: 8bit, 10bit, 12bit. Most LED walls are 8bit color. Sometimes we prefer more depending on the content.
